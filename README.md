# Scheme-Interpreter

An interpreter for a subset of the Scheme language. The subset of the language used in this project is described in the [functional programming](https://www.composingprograms.com/pages/32-functional-programming.html) section of Composing Programs, as well as this [language specification](https://cs61a.org/articles/scheme-spec/) and [built-in procedure reference](https://cs61a.org/articles/scheme-builtins/).

Read-Eval-Print: The interpreter reads Scheme expressions, evaluates them, and displays the results.
