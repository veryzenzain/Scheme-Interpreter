An interpreter for a subset of the Scheme language. The subset of the language used in this project is described in the [functional programming]([url](https://www.composingprograms.com/pages/32-functional-programming.html)) section of Composing Programs, as well as this language specification and built-in procedure reference.

Read-Eval-Print: The interpreter reads Scheme expressions, evaluates them, and displays the results.
